*Ai Image Generator*

You can use this project to showcase in your portfolio, you just need to change the API TOKEN KEY.

In the script.js file you will see: const OPENAI_API_KEY = "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";

You just need to insert your token key which you will receive are creating a new account on OPENAI and go to this link" https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

You can then create a new API key and use here: OPENAI_API_KEY = "**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**"

Thanks!
